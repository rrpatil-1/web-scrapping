# Web scraping

Web scraping is an automated method used to extract a large amount of data from a website. 
As doing it manually consumes a huge amount of time, which can be simplified using a web scraping tool.

Most of the data on websites is in unstructured format. With the help of web scrapping, we can convert this data into a structured format, such as CSV, JSON files.

There are different ways to scrape websites, such as online Services, APIs, or writing your own code.
While some websites allow it, some require authentication.
An organization can use this data to improve user experience, compare the price of a product, make improvements in an existing product, or create a new product.
